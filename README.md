CP1-MS2 MotorPH Payroll System

1. Project Description
The MotorPH Payroll System is a Java-based program that reads employee information and attendance records from CSV files and calculates the total hours worked per payroll cutoff period.
The system processes attendance logs and summarizes work hours according to MotorPH’s payroll schedule:
Cutoff 1: Day 1–15
Cutoff 2: Day 16–End of Month
This milestone focuses on file processing, attendance computation, and payroll summary display.

2. System Objectives
The program aims to:
Read employee information from a CSV file
Retrieve attendance records for a specific employee
Compute daily working hours using login and logout times
Group total hours based on payroll cutoff periods
Display a payroll summary for each cutoff

3. System Architecture Data Source
The system reads two CSV files:

File
Description
Employee Details CSV
Contains employee personal information
Attendance Record CSV
Contains daily login and logout timesProject Directory Structure

6. Program Execution FlowStep 1 – User Input
The program requests the employee number.
Enter Employee #:
This value will be used to search the employee details file.
Step 2 – Load Employee Details
The system reads the employee CSV file and searches for the entered employee number.
Processing steps:
Open employee details CSV file
Skip the header row
Read each line
Split data using commas
Compare employee number
If the employee exists, the following details are stored:
Employee Number
Last Name
First Name
Birthday
If the employee does not exist, the system prints:
Employee does not exist.

7. Display Employee Information
Once the employee record is found, the program prints:
===================================
Employee # :
Employee Name :
Birthday :
===================================
This confirms the selected employee before processing attendance.

8. Attendance Processing
The program processes attendance records from:
June – December 2024
For each month, two counters are used:

Variable
Description
firstHalf
Total hours from day 1–15
secondHalf
Total hours from day 16–end
The last day of each month is calculated using:
YearMonth.of(2024, month).lengthOfMonth();

9. Reading Attendance Records
The system reads the attendance CSV file line by line.
Processing steps:
Skip the header row
Ignore empty rows
Split the row using commas
Process only rows that match the selected employee number

10. Date and Time Processing
Each attendance record contains:

Field
Description
Date
Attendance date
Log In
Employee login time
Log Out
Employee logout time
Example values:
06/03/2024
8:59
18:31
Time values are parsed using:
DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("H:mm");

11. Computing Daily Work Hours
The system calculates hours worked using the method:
computeHours(LocalTime login, LocalTime logout)
Work Rules Applied
Rule
Value
Grace Period
8:10 AM
Work End Time
5:00 PM
Lunch Break
1 Hour
Maximum Work Hours
8 HoursLogic
If logout exceeds 5:00 PM, it is adjusted to 5:00 PM
Total minutes worked are calculated
60 minutes are deducted for lunch
Minutes are converted to hours
Hours are limited to a maximum of 8 hours
If login is before 8:10 AM, the employee receives the full 8 hours credit

12. Payroll Cutoff Assignment
Hours worked are grouped based on the day of the month.

Day
Payroll Cutoff
1–15
First Cutoff
16–End
Second Cutoff

13. Payroll Summary Output
For each month, the program prints the summary.
First Cutoff (1–15)
Total Hours Worked
Gross Salary
Net Salary
Second Cutoff (16–End)
Total Hours Worked
Gross Salary
Deductions
SSS
PhilHealth
Pag-IBIG
Tax
Net Salary
Salary and deduction values are currently placeholders.

14. Current System Limitations
The system only processes attendance records from 2024
Salary and deduction calculations are not yet implemented
CSV files must remain inside the resources folder

15. Future Improvements
The following features may be added in future milestones:
Salary computation based on hourly rate
Automatic calculation of deductions (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, Tax)
Support for multiple payroll years
Export payroll results to a file
